#### Goal of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing insurance charges and to create a predictive model that estimates these charges based on various independent variables. This involves examining the relationships between features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, and how they collectively impact insurance costs.


### Project Outline

#### 1. Data Explanation and Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- **Data Description**: The dataset consists of various features, including:
  - **Independent Variables**: Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoking Status, Region.
  - **Target Variable**: Insurance Charges.
  
- **Learning Type**: This analysis falls under **supervised learning** because it utilizes labeled data (insurance charges) to train a predictive model.

#### 2. Estimate Minimum Sample Size for 99% Accurate Predictions
To ensure that the predictions are accurate with a confidence level of 99% and a precision of 0.02, the minimum sample size can be estimated using statistical methods. This calculation helps determine how many data points are required for reliable predictions.

#### 3. Data Cleaning
- **Null Values**: Evaluate the dataset for any missing values and address them by imputation or removal.
- **Duplicates**: Identify and eliminate any duplicate entries in the dataset to maintain data integrity.
- **Outliers**: Analyze the data for outliers that could skew results and consider appropriate handling techniques.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical string variables into numerical format to facilitate analysis and modeling.

#### 4. Statistical Independence of Sex and Smoking
Utilize statistical tests (such as the Chi-Square test) to determine if there is a significant association between sex and smoking status. A p-value below 0.05 indicates that the variables are statistically dependent.

#### 5. Independence of Regressor Variables
Check for multicollinearity among independent variables using correlation matrices or variance inflation factors (VIF). Independent variables should not exhibit strong correlations, as this could affect model performance.

#### 6. Dependency Between Response and Regressors
Analyze the relationship between the target variable (insurance charges) and independent variables through statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression modeling. This step helps in understanding which features significantly impact the target variable.

#### 7. Predicting the Regression Line
Develop a regression model using appropriate techniques (e.g., linear regression) to create a regression line. This line will be utilized for predicting insurance charges based on the independent variables.

#### 8. Model Accuracy Prediction
Evaluate the regression model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts insurance charges.

#### 9. Predicting Insurance Charges
Use the regression model to estimate insurance charges for a specific set of inputs, such as:
- Age: 29
- Sex: Female
- BMI: 28
- Number of Children: 1
- Smoking Status: Yes
- Region: Southeast

#### 10. Percentage of Error in the Regression Model
Calculate the percentage of error in the predictions to assess the model's accuracy. This can be done by comparing predicted values to actual values and determining the average error percentage.

#### 11. 95% Confidence Interval for Average Charges
Compute the 95% confidence interval for the average insurance charge, providing a range within which the true mean of insurance charges is expected to fall. This statistical measure adds credibility to the prediction results.

Summarize the findings from the analysis, including key insights about the relationship between the independent variables and insurance charges, the effectiveness of the predictive model, and potential areas for future research.
